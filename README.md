# Font Subsetting for Everyone

**Fontset** uses the **Google Fonts API**, to **subset** a font based on characters you need, creating a tiny font to self-host.

You don't have to install anything, or understand [unicode ranges](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/%40font-face/unicode-range) but the downside is that you're limited to **Google Fonts**.

I wrote a detailed post on [using fonts on the web](https://joyofcode.xyz/using-fonts-on-the-web) explaining everything in great detail.
